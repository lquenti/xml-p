# Exercise 1.9 (Shared Islands)

> b) The database does not contain information, what portion of the island belongs to each of the
> countries.
>
> i) Extend the ER-Diagram to model this information (see Mondial Web page for it).
> ii) Consider how this can be realized in the Mondial XML database.
> iii) Extend the DTD and insert the appropriate information into the database. Data can e.g.
> be found at Wikipedia.


## Solution

### i) ER-Diagram Extension
- Add a relationship `owned_by` between islands and countries
- Include attribute `percentage` or other measure, e.g. `area` to indicate ownership share
- Total area portions can be calculated using the island's total area

### ii) XML Database Implementation
Current structure uses a reference to the country. Proposed change:
- Replace with `owned_by` subelements
- Each subelement contains country reference and percentage or area share

### iii) DTD Extension


Using percentage as measure:

```diff
 <!ELEMENT island (name+,islands?,located*,area?,latitude?,longitude?,elevation?
+ ,owned_by*)>
 <!ATTLIST island id ID #REQUIRED
                  sea IDREFS #IMPLIED
                  lake IDREF #IMPLIED
                  river IDREFS #IMPLIED
-                 country IDREFS #REQUIRED
                  type (volcanic|coral|atoll|lime) #IMPLIED>
                  
+ <!ELEMENT owned_by EMPTY>
+ <!ATTLIST owned_by country IDREF #REQUIRED
+                    percentage CDATA #REQUIRED>
```

Using area as measure:

```diff
 <!ELEMENT island (name+,islands?,located*,area?,latitude?,longitude?,elevation?
+ ,owned_by*)>
 <!ATTLIST island id ID #REQUIRED
                  sea IDREFS #IMPLIED
                  lake IDREF #IMPLIED
                  river IDREFS #IMPLIED
-                 country IDREFS #REQUIRED
                  type (volcanic|coral|atoll|lime) #IMPLIED>
                  
+ <!ELEMENT owned_by EMPTY>
+ <!ATTLIST owned_by country IDREF #REQUIRED
+                    area CDATA #REQUIRED>
```

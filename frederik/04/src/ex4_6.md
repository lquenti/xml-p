### **When DTDs Are Better**
1. **Simplicity**
    - Great for basic configurations or small-scale projects (e.g., config files, legacy systems).
    - Used in resource-limited environments where lightweight validation is sufficient.

2. **Legacy Compatibility**
    - Works well with older tools, protocols, and standards (e.g., RSS feeds, XHTML 1.0).

### **When XML Schema Is Better**
1. **Data Integrity**
    - Ideal for databases or structured data transfer, enforcing data types and constraints (e.g., numbers, dates).

2. **Complex Structures**
    - Suitable for hierarchical or dynamic systems (e.g., legal documents, tax filings).

3. **Namespaces**
    - Necessary for large-scale integrations or multi-source data (e.g., APIs, web services).

4. **Future-Proofing**
    - Best for evolving industries with strict requirements (e.g., healthcare records, financial reports).

---

**Summary:**
- Use **DTDs** for simple or legacy systems.
- Use **XML Schema** for databases, APIs, complex documents, and systems requiring strict validation or namespaces.
